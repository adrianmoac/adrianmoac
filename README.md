## Hello!
My name is Adrián. I am currently studying a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, graduating in June 2025. 
I love big challenges, using new technologies and learning new things.

## My strongest technologies

Javascript and Typescript have become my most important languages in which I have had almost all my experience in web development. This makes me confident to say that it would take me not much time to learn a new framework that uses this language.
